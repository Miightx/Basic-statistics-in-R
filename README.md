Basic statistics were conducted in the repository. We analyzed the influence of blood sugar on various elements such as insulin or glucagon. Therefore, we performed frequentist and Bayesian statistics in R, and compared those results with those from JASP.

In this repository, you will find the R code, the report, and the data tables.
